## About the Project
I got tired of not having any themes that I can easily edit to my liking. 
I needed something easy to use, simple to understand and responsive.
Bootstrap is a great starting point that pretty much does all of the above.
So I decided to make a base starting theme, using Bootstrap as a reference point.
